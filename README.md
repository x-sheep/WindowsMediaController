# MediaSession Stream thing

This is a widget that displays the currently playing Media Item, and is intended for livestreaming. It uses [DubyaDude's WindowsMediaController package](https://github.com/DubyaDude/WindowsMediaController) to read from the Windows 10/11 API.

This widget is only available as an executable. You can capture the window and overlay it using your streaming software of choice. The program does not need an internet connection.
